# String Calculator (TDD Kata)

This is a simple implementation of a String Calculator using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles in Ruby. The project includes basic functionality for adding numbers from a string, handling custom delimiters, and raising exceptions for negative numbers.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby 
- Minitest 

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kushtiwari13/string_calculator.git
    cd string_calculator
    ```

2. Install any necessary gems (if not already installed):
    ```bash
    gem install minitest
    ```

## Running Tests

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you're in the project directory.
2. Run the test file:
    ```bash
    ruby string_calculator_test.rb
    ```

## Additional Notes

- The tests are written using **Minitest**.
- The project follows **TDD** principles, so tests are written first, then the code is implemented to pass the tests.
